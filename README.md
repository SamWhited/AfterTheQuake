# After the Quake

[DramaTech Theatre](http://dramatech.org) at [Georgia Tech](http://gatech.edu) is currently scheduled to perform Frank Galati and Haruki Murakami's 'After the Quake' in [February of 2012](http://dramatech.org/shows/details/87). This repo contains a proposed set design for the show.

## Synopsis

In the aftermath of a terrible earthquake, a writer fueled by heartbreak heals a broken little girl, while a menacing frog saves Tokyo from an enormous worm. Adapted from the short stories of Haruki Marakami, Galati’s play brings to life Murakami’s “hallucinatory world where the real and surreal merge and overlap, where dreams and real-life nightmares are impossible to tell apart”. (New York Times)
